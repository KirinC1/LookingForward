            I am looking forward to going to Big Rocks during this summer. Big Rocks is a wilderness park in Nevada. I was originally 
            going to go with some friends, but because of the pandemic, we are unable to go together, so I will be going with my family. Big Rocks is a sacred 
            place, with many legends about it's dark past. Some say that many people who enter the desert, never come back.
